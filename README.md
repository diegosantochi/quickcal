# QuickCal

A CLI CalDAV client.

### Installation

Clone this repository and run:
```shell
make build
```

Copy the binary at `./bin/qc` to a directory in your `$PATH`

Binaries will be provided soon

### Configuration

The application reads a YAML configuration file from `~/.calendar.yaml`. The configuration file has the following structure:
```
servers:
    - name: ""
      url: ""
      user: ""
      password: ""
      calendars:
        - name: ""
          path: ""
          color: ""
          default: true

timezone: ""
```

`timezone` is the [tz name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)

The `calendars` array doesn't need to be specified manually, it is automatically generated by running the `calendar config` command

### Usage and help

1. Create a config file at `$HOME/.calendar.yaml` or copy it from this repo [calendar.example.yaml](./calendar.example.yaml). Fill in the name, url, user and password fields
2. Generate the calendars array
```shell
qc calendar config
```
3. To list all events in the next 7 days, run:
```
qc event list
```
Parameters `--from` and `--to` can be used to specify a different date range

5. to add a new event, run:
```
qc event add
``` 

To get the complete list of commands, run:
```shell
calendar --help
```

### Default calendar

The default calendar is the one used by default by the `event add` command. It can be changed directly in the configuration file,
or by running the `calendar config` command.

To show the current default calendar, run:
```shell
qc calendar default
```
